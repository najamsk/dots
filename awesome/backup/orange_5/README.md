bone3ye's Awesome Config & Themes
=================================

Here you will find my awesomeWM configs and themes and other dotfiles.
Alot of my widgets borrow from Pavel Markhov's work (streetturtle), and the original
awesome config borrowed from zilt0id/f-s0ciety. Magnificent bastards.

The current theme is called chairman, after the Maxell chair guy.
